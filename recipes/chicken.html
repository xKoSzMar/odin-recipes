    <h1>Crispy Fried Chicken</h1>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken</li>
      <li>Buttermilk</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Seasonings</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the
        bag and shake until well-combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both
        sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk. Place the soaked
        chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat.
        Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the
        flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken
        on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for
        about 30 minutes. Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry
        until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.

    </ul>
