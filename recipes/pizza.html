    <h1>Pizza Neapoletana</h1>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>600 ml warm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>875 g type 00 flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        “Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water.
        Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle
        and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix
        until a shaggy dough begins to form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work
        surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth,
        and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside,
        turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at
        least an hour, or up to 24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work
        surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions
        and shape into rounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest
        for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any
        other ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 230-260˚C.
        Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface
        is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes
        and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food
        processor, and puree until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the
        surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner
        than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up
        during baking.
      </li>
      <li>Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.</li>
      <li>
        Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15
        minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
